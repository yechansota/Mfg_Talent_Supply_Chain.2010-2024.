📋 Overview
This project analyzes the structural collapse of the manufacturing workforce pipeline in the U.S. Energy Belt region. Using federal government data (Census J2J, IPEDS, BLS), we decompose workforce attrition into five interconnected risk layers and provide actionable insights for HR practitioners.


Layer 1: AGING RISK          → How fast is workforce depleting?
         ↓                       λ = 4.4%/yr, Half-Life = 15.8yr
Layer 2: ATTRITION RISK      → Why do people leave voluntarily?
         ↓                       Structural Gap = 6.6%p
Layer 3: HIRING CAPACITY     → Can we replace those who leave?
         ↓                       RR = 0.25 (trend: -0.0064/yr)
Layer 4: TRAINING CAPACITY   → Can we train new hires properly?
         ↓                       Mentor Stock declining
Layer 5: EXTERNAL COMPETITION → Are others stealing our talent?
                                 Net Flow: -3.1%p to other industries


Layer 1: Aging Risk

Model: Exponential Decay (N(t) = N₀ × e^(-λt))
Baseline λ: 4.4%/year (BLS Table 1.10)
Accelerated λ: 6.6%/year (Baby Boomer peak scenario)
Result: Half-life reduces from 15.8 → 10.5 years under acceleration

Layer 2: Attrition Risk

Metric: Structural Gap = Total Separation - Natural Exit
Manufacturing Gap: 6.6%p (highest among peer industries)
Comparison: Construction (3.1%p), Logistics (4.2%p), Retail (5.6%p)

Layer 3: Hiring Capacity

3-A (J2J): Replacement Ratio = Young Inflow / Senior Outflow

2010: RR = 0.95 | 2024: RR = 0.25 | 2035 forecast: 0.18
Statistical significance: p = 0.001, R² = 0.87


3-B (IPEDS): Supply = 33,047 vs Demand = 35,700 → Gap = -2,653/year

Layer 4: Training Capacity

Concept: Senior depletion → Mentoring loss → Poor training → Higher turnover
Policy Impact: Phased retirement can preserve +7.3pts mentor stock by 2035

Layer 5: External Competition

Method: Markov transition matrix from J2J data
Result: Manufacturing net loss of -3.1%p to other industries
Primary Competitor: Logistics (+5.3%p gain)
